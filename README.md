# fastai_projects

A tidy collection of projects from the 2022 edition of the FastAI Practical Deep Learning for Coders course.
You can access the course here: https://course.fast.ai

Most projects follow along somewhat closely with the lectures, but I try to deviate/differentiate in certain places so I can get a better grasp on concepts.

The mini-projects include:
1. Car Make Classifier
2. Birds of Prey Classifier deployed to HuggingFace spaces with gradio
3. Implementing Gradient Descent
4. US patent phrasing similarity NLP (Kaggle Competition)
5. Predicting survivors of the Titanic + building a NN from scratch (Kaggle Competition)
6. ???
7. ???
8. ???
9. ???
