# fastai_projects

A tidy collection of projects from the 2022 edition of the FastAI Practical Deep Learning for Coders course.
You can access the course here: https://course.fast.ai

One of the learning methods suggested in the course is to try to replicate examples discussed in class on new datasets. That's what I've done with these mini-projects.


The mini-projects include:
1. Car Make Classifier
2. Birds of Prey Classifier deployed to HuggingFace spaces
3. Gradient Descent from scratch
4. Sentiment Analysis for Yelp reviews
5. Neural Net from scratch for MNIST Digit Recognizer
6. ???
